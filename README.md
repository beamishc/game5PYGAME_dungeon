# Teeny Tiny RPG
## Summary
Teeny Tiny RPG is a game with almost no game mechanics (YET!), entirely designed to practice my Object Oriented Programming and my Python in my spare time - in a way that is completely divorced from work.

## How to play the game
Use the arrow keys to move left, right, forward or backward.
Avoid the enemies, talk to NPCs (probably, eventually), collect weapons and treasure.
Advance up the levels!

## Installation
To run this application, download the GitHub zip file or clone the repository. Then, in your terminal, run:
```bash
python start.py
```
You will be asked to enter a player name for your save file, name it something memorable, you'll need it the next time you want to play the game:
```bash
python start.py <player_name>
```

## Tools used in this game:
**Python 3.10.6** - for everything
**Pygame** - for the game structure
**Pytmx** - for the maps
